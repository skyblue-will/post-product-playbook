        <div class="opening">
            A product is a compromise. Someone built something general enough to sell to thousands of people. You adapted to it. You accepted that the features you actually needed were "on the roadmap" or "not how the platform works." This was rational. Custom software cost £50–500k. So you lived with the gap between what you wanted and what you got. <strong>That gap is about to close.</strong>
        </div>
        
        <!-- Q1 -->
        <div class="section">
            <p class="question">"But AI Can't Build Real Software"</p>
            
            <p>It already does. Today. In production.</p>
            
            <p>We have a management system for an amateur operatic society — meetings, actions, members, PDF minutes — built entirely by an AI agent, deployed on modern infrastructure, used by real people to run a real organisation.</p>
            
            <p>Not a demo. Not a prototype. The actual system they rely on.</p>
            
            <p>It was built in days, not months. It costs pennies to run. When they want a change, they describe it in plain English and it's live by tomorrow.</p>
        </div>
        
        <!-- Q2 -->
        <div class="section">
            <p class="question">"Fine, But That's One App. It Won't Scale"</p>
            
            <p>Why not? The patterns are remarkably similar:</p>
            
            <ul class="use-cases">
                <li>Plumber job tracking</li>
                <li>Estate agent workflows</li>
                <li>Nursery management</li>
                <li>Restaurant operations</li>
                <li>Accountancy practice tools</li>
                <li>Landlord portfolios</li>
                <li>Salon bookings</li>
                <li>Club membership</li>
                <li>Trades quoting</li>
                <li>Veterinary practices</li>
                <li>Freelancer CRMs</li>
                <li>School administration</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Different specifics, same bones. An AI agent that's built one of these can build a thousand variations. Each one bespoke. Each one exactly what that person or business actually needs.</p>
            
            <p>The 500th build is dramatically faster than the 5th — because every build teaches the system.</p>
        </div>
        
        <!-- Q3 -->
        <div class="section">
            <p class="question">"People Won't Trust AI-Built Software"</p>
            
            <p>Correct. And that's the entire insight.</p>
            
            <p>The tech world is racing toward full autonomy — more AI, less human, automate everything. But most people aren't in the tech world. Most people heard about AI on the news and aren't sure if it's going to take their job or leak their data.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight">You don't sell them "AI-built software." You sell them "a managed service with professional oversight." Same thing. Completely different emotional response.</div>
            
            <p>The human layer — security engineers, pen testing, incident response — isn't a cost centre. It's the trust licence. It's what turns a scary AI capability into something a committee treasurer will sign off on.</p>
            
            <p>The companies that win won't be the most autonomous. They'll be the ones who made autonomy feel safe.</p>
        </div>
        
        <hr>
        
        <!-- Q4: The Missing Piece -->
        <div class="section-wide">
            <p class="question">"So What's Missing?"</p>
            
            <p>Security. That's it. That's the missing piece of the puzzle.</p>
            
            <p>The AI capability is here. The infrastructure is free at small scale. The economics work. The demand exists — millions of organisations running on spreadsheets and WhatsApp because nothing else fits.</p>
            
            <p>Everything is in place except the bit that makes it trustworthy.</p>
            
            <p>An AI agent can build you a beautiful membership system in a day. But can it guarantee that system isn't leaking your members' data? Can it prove there are no vulnerabilities?</p>
            
            <p>No. Because the API is the building, not the inspector. You can build in smoke alarms and fire doors, but someone still needs to test whether the fire doors actually open.</p>
            
            <p>Automated checks get you 95% of the way. But the final sign-off — the "yes, this is actually secure" — requires a human who's accountable.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="centrepiece">
            <p>The AI builds.<br>The human secures.<br>That's the full product.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section-wide">
            <p>Without the security layer, this is a toy. With it, it's a business. It's the trust licence. It's the moat. And it's what no one else in the AI-builds-apps space is taking seriously.</p>
        </div>
        
        <hr>
        
        <!-- Q5 -->
        <div class="section">
            <p class="question">"This Is Just Outsourced Development"</p>
            
            <p>No. Outsourced development is a one-time transaction: you pay, you get code, the developer leaves, and you're stuck maintaining it or paying again.</p>
            
            <p>This is an ongoing relationship. The agent that built your system stays. It knows your setup, your data model, your preferences. When you say "add a field for allergies on the signup form" it doesn't need a brief, a spec, or a sprint planning meeting. It just does it.</p>
            
            <p>And crucially — there's a human security team behind it that audits continuously.</p>

            <div class="econ-grid">

            <p>Compare SaaS: you need a product team, a support team, a sales team, and you're burning cash until you hit thousands of customers. The economics here are <em>better</em> than SaaS, not worse.</p>

            <p class="question">"Who Actually Wants This?"</p>
            
            <p>There are <span class="stat">5.5 million</span> small businesses in the UK — <span class="stat">99.2%</span> of all UK businesses. The plumber using a notebook. The estate agent whose CRM doesn't match how they actually work. The nursery managing allergies, ratios, and parent comms across three different apps. The restaurant doing bookings on one system, stock on another, and staff rotas on a third.</p>
            
            <p>Every one of them is using software that doesn't quite fit — or no software at all. These aren't underserved markets. They're <strong>unserved</strong> markets. Products that fit them perfectly have never existed because the economics didn't allow it. Now they do.</p>

            <p class="question">"Why Should I Believe You?"</p>
            
            <p>Because we've already done it. A real system, for a real organisation, built and maintained by an agent, running in production. Not a pitch deck with mockups. A URL you can visit.</p>
            
            <p>The committee treasurer using a shared Google Drive doesn't know a bespoke system is now affordable. The freelancer juggling 5 apps doesn't know they could have one that does exactly what they need.</p>
            
            <p>They'll know when someone shows them.</p>
